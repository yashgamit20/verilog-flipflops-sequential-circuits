# Flip-Flops & Sequential Circuits in Verilog

This repo contains my Verilog implementations and testbenches for various flip-flops and FSMs from **Chapter 5** of my DLD study.

## ✅ Completed Modules

| Flip-Flop / Circuit        | Description                             |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| D Flip-Flop (Async & Sync Reset) | Basic D FF with both types of reset |
| JK Flip-Flop              | Standard JK implementation              |
| T Flip-Flop as Counter    | T FF used as a 3-bit synchronous counter |
| FSM                       | A basic FSM using boolean equations     |
| Master-Slave JK           | Master-slave FF logic                   |
| Edge-Triggered D FF       | Positive edge-triggered design          |
